# doItInYourPants
  Death counter addon for casual (not hc) players. 

  This addon provides death statistics for non hc characters. If you want to have classic WOW experience, train yourself up or make personal challenge it suits you well.

  At current stage of development addon gives information how many times you were dead in two cases:
  - after you logged in (you may need to scroll up a little);
  - upon death;
